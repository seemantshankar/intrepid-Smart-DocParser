# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan breaks down the Contract Analysis and Milestone Extraction system into a standalone microservice project that exposes REST APIs for the main Smart Payment Infrastructure to consume. Each task focuses on implementing specific functionality as an independent service while providing clear API contracts for integration. The plan follows test-driven development principles and prioritizes early validation of core functionality through API endpoints.
